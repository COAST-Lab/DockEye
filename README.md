# Open Fluorometer

## About

This is the repository for an in-development, open-source, low-cost fluorometer for measuring water quality parameters. The current objective is measuring chlorophyll-*a* and turbidity,
though more parameters may be added in the future. 

This sensor is continuing the research from the now depreciated https://github.com/COAST-Lab/Low-Cost-Multiparameter-Water-Quality-Sensor built using the Particle Argon microcontroller. 
The new version use an Espressif ESP32-S3, which uses the Arduino IDE rather than the Particle Workbench.

Funding for this project comes from the MOORE Foundation through the SOCON (Sustained Ocean Color Observations from Nanosatellites) program.

## Introduction

This sensor is built using an Adafruit ESP32-S3 Feather microcontroller, an Adafruit Adalogger Featherwing, an AS7341 light sensor, an AW9523 LED driver, LEDs, and an enclosure. 
This repository will contain circuit diagrams and instructions for building the sensor, code for flashing to the microcontroller, 3D printer models for the enclosure, 
scripts for data analysis, etc. This sensor is in active development, and this repository will be updated continuously as progress is made. Stay tuned!
