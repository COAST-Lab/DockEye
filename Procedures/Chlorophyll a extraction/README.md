## Chlorophyll-a extraction method

# Extraction

1. Cut up spinach leaves and weigh out 4 g (I did 4 g with a very high extraction efficiency, you could likely do much less).

2. Grind in mortar and pestle with 5-10 mL cold acetone

3. Grind until particles are too small to be seen clearly. 

4. Transfer into glass amber bottle with 20 mL 80% acetone. 

5. Sonicate in ice bath for 30 minutes.

6. Transfer to amber centrifuge tubes.

7. Centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes. 

8. Transfer supernatant into glass amber bottle.

9. Dilute as needed to bring the values within second instrument calibration curve.

10. Measure on second instrument to determine the needed dilution.

# Calibration standard preparation 

1. Dilute to 100 μg/L for CS5. 

2. Dilute to 50 μg/L for CS4 (2x dilution from CS5 in 80% acetone). 

3. Dilute to 20 μg/L for CS3 (2.5x from CS4 dilution in 80% acetone). 

4. Dilute to 10 μg/L for CS2 (2x dilution from CS3 in 80% acetone). 

5. Dilute to 5 μg/L for CS1 (2x dilution from CS2 in 80% acetone).
